# Testing

Use a tool like Postman to test your server's endpoints for each HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/ to test the root endpoint.

Send a POST request with JSON data to http://localhost:3000/api to test the POST endpoint.

Send a PUT request with JSON data to http://localhost:3000/api to test the PUT endpoint.

Send a DELETE request to http://localhost:3000/api to test the DELETE endpoint.
